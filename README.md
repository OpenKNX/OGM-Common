# OpenKNX Common

OpenKNX Common is a library meant to be used once in every OpenKNX Device firmware.

The main functions are:
- setup and calling the knx stack
- setup and calling of the OpenKNX Modules
- flash handling for persistent data of the OpenKNX Modules

## Usage

It is designed for usage with the headerfile generated by [OpenKNXproducer](https://github.com/OpenKNX/OpenKNXproducer), which provides the necessary defines in knxprod.h:
```
MAIN_OpenKnxId
MAIN_ApplicationNumber
MAIN_ApplicationVersion

# optional (delivered by OAM-LogicModule)
LOG_StartupDelayBase
ParamLOG_StartupDelayTimeMS
LOG_HeartbeatDelayBase
KoLOG_Heartbeat
ParamLOG_HeartbeatDelayTimeMS
```
## Hardware

| ARCH   | info                                                                    |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RP2040 | the reference platform with full support (including dual core support) |
| SAMD21 | obsolete but still supported. no hw should be developed on this anymore |
| ESP32  | experimental                                                            |

To configure the Hardware-Setup use the following defines in hardware.h

```
SAVE_INTERRUPT_PIN
INFO_LED_PIN
PROG_BUTTON_PIN
PROG_LED_PIN_ACTIVE_ON
PROG_LED_PIN
KNX_UART_RX_PIN
KNX_UART_TX_PIN
```

### Heartbeat (Mode: Normal)
You can enable a debug heartbeat to see if a loop is stuck. The progLed (for loop) and infoLed (for loop1) will blinking if the loop hangs.

### Heartbeat (Mode: Prio)
In the prio mode the leds blinking (`OPENKNX_HEARTBEAT_PRIO_OFF_FREQ`) and stop as soon as the relevant loop hangs.
If programing mode is active, the progLed will blink faster (`OPENKNX_HEARTBEAT_PRIO_ON_FREQ`).

So, if the device is NOT blinking, anything is wrong.
